# jobLogger
Searching for jobs is hard. Keeping up with all of the jobs you have applied for can be even harder.
The jobLogger app helps you track all of the jobs that you have applied for; along with important details about the job.
The app takes the client's input about their job (compnay name, title, salary, level of interest, etc), saves all of it in 
a MySQL database, and displays it on the home page. The user is able to add comments, add job entries to an archive list, delete 
entries, and more. This app also has user authentication so all of your information is safe and secured. 
Build: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Passport.js, MySQL, AWS(deployment).
